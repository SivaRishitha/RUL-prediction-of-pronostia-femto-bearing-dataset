# RUL-prediction-of-pronostia-femto-bearing-dataset
Pronostia femto bearing dataset provides run-to-failure (RTF) data for bearings under different operating conditions, allowing researchers to develop models for bearing failure prediction.
To predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of bearings at various cycles in the test dataset, we first need to extract features from the training dataset by analyzing and visualizing the data.
Next, we train a regression model of our choice using these extracted features.
Finally, we apply the same feature extraction process to the test dataset and evaluate it using the trained regression model.
Finding RMSE between ground truth and predicted values of RUL.
Evaluating the performance of the trained model.
